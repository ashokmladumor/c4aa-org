# The C4AA.org WordPress Theme

[C4AA.org](https://c4aa.org)

A child theme of the standard [WordPress Twenty Nineteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentynineteen/) theme.

Our aims are:

## 1. Create a site that aligns with the Center for Artistic Activism Design Standards

We have some design standards created by [Diane Shaw](https://www.behance.net/dianeshaw), then built upon over the years in our Center for Artistic Activism print material and by subsequent designers like [Andy Outis](https://www.andyoutis.com/).

## 2. Code as few modifications as possible.

Minimize use of plugins, javascript, and other dependencies. 

# Contributing to this site
C4AA welcomes all contributions to the C4AA website. 

## Understanding Issues and Requests
* We use GitHub Issues to tracking problems, bugs and feature requests for the website. If you see something wrong with the site, or some change you think would be helpful, feel free to create an Issue and we'll review it. 
* Issues marked with the "request" tag have been created by the site administrators and generally reference one or more Issues. These represent "tasks" or "actions" requested by the site administrators and are a great way to push the site forward and make things better. If "issues" represent a problem, "requests" represent a proposed solution that we'd like to see actioned. 
* To make code contributions to the codebase, please follow the guidelines below.
